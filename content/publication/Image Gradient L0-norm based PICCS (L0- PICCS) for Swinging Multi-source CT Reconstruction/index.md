abstract:'Dynamic computed tomography (CT) is usually employed to image motion objects, such as beating heart, coronary artery and cerebral perfusion, etc. Recently, to further improve the temporal resolution for aperiodic industrial process imaging, the swinging multi-source CT (SMCT) systems and the corresponding swinging multi-source prior image constrained compressed sensing (SM-PICCS) method were developed. Since the SM-PICCS uses the L1-norm of image gradient, the edge structures in the reconstructed images are blurred and motion artifacts are still present. Inspired by the advantages in terms of image edge preservation and fine structure recovering, the L0-norm of image gradient is incorporated into the prior image constrained compressed sensing, leading to an L0-PICCS Algorithm 1Table 1The parameters of L0-PICCS (δ1,δ2,λ1*,λ2*) for numerical simulation.Sourceswδ1(10-2)δ2(10-2)λ1*(10-2)λ2*(10-8)Noise-free510522.001.525522.001.55035002.00471014.33332.00500025522.00500050222.005000Noise51062002.505002554502.501.55054502.901.571027.385.91.5810000258.285.91.5850050522.001.5. The experimental results confirm that the L0-PICCS outperforms the SM-PICCS in both visual inspection and quantitative analysis.'
