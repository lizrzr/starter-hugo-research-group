abstract: 'Image denoising is a prerequisite for downstream tasks in many fields. Low-dose and photon-counting computed tomography (CT) denoising can optimize diagnostic performance at minimized radiation dose. Supervised deep denoising methods are popular but require paired clean or noisy samples that are often unavailable in practice. Limited by the independent noise assumption, current self-supervised denoising methods cannot process correlated noises as in CT images. Here we propose the first-of-its-kind similarity-based self-supervised deep denoising approach, referred to as Noise2Sim, that works in a nonlocal and nonlinear fashion to suppress not only independent but also correlated noises. Theoretically, Noise2Sim is asymptotically equivalent to supervised learning methods under mild conditions. Experimentally, Nosie2Sim recovers intrinsic features from noisy low-dose CT and photon-counting CT images as effectively as or even better than supervised learning methods on practical datasets visually, quantitatively and statistically. Noise2Sim is a general self-supervised denoising approach and has great potential in diverse applications.'
