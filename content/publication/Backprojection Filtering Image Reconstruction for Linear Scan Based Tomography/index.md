abstract: In our early work, an ultra-low-cost linear scan based tomography architecture was proposed. Similar to linear tomosynthesis, the source and detector are translated in opposite directions and the data acquisition system targets a region of interest (ROI) to acquire limited and truncated data for image reconstruction. In our preliminary study, the FBP and ART image reconstruction algorithms for ROI reconstruction were proposed. In this paper, we utilize the BPF (Backprojection Filtering) algorithm to reconstruct the ROI images and compare the BPF algorithm with the aforementioned algorithms.
