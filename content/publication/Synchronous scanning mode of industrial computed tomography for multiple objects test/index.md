abstract: When testing small size and high density objects with a broad field-of-view (FOV) industrial CT system, multiple objects are always assembled evenly onto the turntable for detecting to improve test efficiency. However, the maximum X-ray's penetrating path through the materials increases, which means the CT system should collocate with a high energy X-ray source and wide-dynamic range detectors to complete the CT scanning. In this study, we proposed and tested a novel and efficient CT scanning method based on linear-arrangement and synchronous-rotating multi-turntables without enhancing the energy of X-ray source and wide-dynamic range of detectors for the CT system. With this modality, multiple objects are assembled onto multiple synchronous-rotating turntables respectively, and X-rays within the FOV merely penetrate one single object when scanning. The corresponding filtered back projection algorithm for image reconstruction is deduced. The computer simulation and experimental results verified the feasibility of this novel method and the scanning time was reduced to 5-8 minutes when completing the scanning of 3 to 5 group objects.
